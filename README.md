# Basic-Book-Club-Website
This repository contains a basic HTML and JavaScript project for loading and displaying books from a JSON file. The project utilizes jQuery for DOM manipulation and asynchronous fetching of data. Users can click a button to load and display books, with each book's title, author, and genre shown in a simple format. The HTML structure is minimal, focusing on functionality.
